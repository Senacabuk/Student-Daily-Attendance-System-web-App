            Collecting and keeping attendance records one by one is a time-consuming and exhausting process.
            Processing paper sheets and timesheets, creating charts, problems such as incorrect data entries may arise.
            For this reason, every organization should have a Attendance management system for its students.
            Attendance Management Systems allow students to accurately calculate their hours at school.
            And it also helps to ensure accurate data recording.
